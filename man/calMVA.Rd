\title{Calibration of seasonal climate forecasts.}
\usage{
calMVA(fcst.grid, obs.grid, crossval = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fcst.grid}{climate4R grid. Forecasts to be calibrated (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis). At the moment, only gridded data are supported.}

\item{obs.grid}{climate4R grid. Reference observations the forecasts are calibrated towards (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis).}

\item{crossval}{Logical. TRUE (default) for leave-one-out cross-validation. FALSE for not cross-validation.}
}
\value{
climate4R grid. Calibrated forecasts.
}
\description{
This function implements the method 1 described in Torralba et al. 2017, which has been previously applied 
in the context of seasonal forecasting to correct temperature and precipitation in Leung et al. 1999.
The ensemble mean produced by this method has the same mean and standard deviation as the observations. 
It is based on the assumption that both the reference and predicted distributions are approximated well by a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

\examples{
{
## loading seasonal forecasts (CFS) and observations (NCEP) of boreal winter temperature over Iberia
require(climate4R.datasets)
data("CFS_Iberia_tas"); fcst = CFS_Iberia_tas
data("NCEP_Iberia_tas"); obs = NCEP_Iberia_tas
## passing from daily data to seasonal averages
fcst = aggregateGrid(fcst, aggr.y = list(FUN = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))
obs = aggregateGrid(obs, aggr.y = list(FUN = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))
## interpolating forecasts to the observations' resolution
fcst = interpGrid(fcst, new.coordinates = getGrid(obs))
## applying calibration
fcst.cal = calMVA(fcst, obs, crossval = TRUE)
## plotting climatologies
library(visualizeR)
spatialPlot(makeMultiGrid(climatology(obs),
                         climatology(fcst, by.member = FALSE),
                         climatology(fcst.cal, by.member = FALSE)),
           backdrop.theme = "coastline",
           layout = c(3, 1),
           names.attr = c("NCEP", "CFS (raw)", "CFS (calibrated)"))
