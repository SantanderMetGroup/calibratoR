\title{Inflation calibration method for seasonal forecasts (a.k.a. climate conserving recalibration)}
\usage{
calCCR(
  fcst.grid,
  obs.grid,
  crossval = TRUE,
  apply.to = c("all", "sig"),
  alpha = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fcst.grid}{climate4R grid. Forecasts to be calibrated (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis). At the moment, only gridded data are supported.}

\item{obs.grid}{climate4R grid. Reference observations the forecasts are calibrated towards (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis).}

\item{crossval}{Logical. TRUE (default) for leave-one-out cross-validation. FALSE for not cross-validation.}

\item{apply.to}{Character. If \code{"all"} is selected, all forecasts are calibrated. Alternatively, if \code{"sig"} is selected, the calibration is only applied 
in those points where the correlation between the ensemble mean and the observations is statistically significant.}

\item{alpha}{Significance (0.1 by default) of the ensemble mean correlation (i.e. \code{"alpha = 0.05"} would correspond to a 95\% confidence level). Only works if \code{"apply.to = sig"}.}
}
\value{
climate4R grid. Calibrated forecasts.
}
\description{
This function implements the EMOS method introduced in Doblas-Reyes et al. 2005
and recently applied in Torralba et al. 2017 (method 2) to produce reliable operational seasonal forecasts of wind speed.
After Weigel et al. 2009, this method is sometimes referred to as climate conserving recalibration (CCR).
}
\note{
Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) methods use the correspondence between the ensemble mean and the observations in the calibration process.

\examples{
{
## loading seasonal forecasts (CFS) and observations (NCEP) of boreal winter temperature over Iberia
require(climate4R.datasets)
data("CFS_Iberia_tas"); fcst = CFS_Iberia_tas
data("NCEP_Iberia_tas"); obs = NCEP_Iberia_tas
## passing from daily data to seasonal averages
fcst = aggregateGrid(fcst, aggr.y = list(FUN = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))
obs = aggregateGrid(obs, aggr.y = list(FUN = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))
## interpolating forecasts to the observations' resolution
fcst = interpGrid(fcst, new.coordinates = getGrid(obs))
## applying calibration
fcst.cal = calCCR(fcst, obs, crossval = TRUE, apply.to = "all")
## plotting climatologies
library(visualizeR)
spatialPlot(makeMultiGrid(climatology(obs),
                          climatology(fcst, by.member = FALSE),
                          climatology(fcst.cal, by.member = FALSE)),
           backdrop.theme = "coastline",
           layout = c(3, 1),
           names.attr = c("NCEP", "CFS (raw)", "CFS (calibrated)"))
