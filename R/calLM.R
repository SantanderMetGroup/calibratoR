#' @title Linear regression based calibration of seasonal climate forecasts
#' @description This function performs an EMOS-like linear regression between the ensemble mean and the corresponding observations. 
#' To correct the forecast variance, the standardized anomalies are rescaled by the standard deviation of the predictive distribution from the linear fitting.
#' @note Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) methods use the correspondence between the ensemble mean and the observations in the calibration process.
#' @param fcst.grid climate4R grid. Forecasts to be calibrated (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis). At the moment, only gridded data are supported.
#' @param obs.grid climate4R grid. Reference observations the forecasts are calibrated towards (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis).
#' @param crossval Logical. TRUE (default) for leave-one-out-out cross-validation. FALSE for not cross-validation.
#' @param apply.to Character. If \code{"all"} is selected, all forecasts are calibrated. Alternatively, if \code{"sig"} is selected, the calibration is only applied 
#' in those points where the correlation between the ensemble mean and the observations is statistically significant.
#' @param alpha Significance (0.1 by default) of the ensemble mean correlation (i.e. \code{"alpha = 0.05"} would correspond to a 95\% confidence level). Only works if \code{"apply.to = sig"}.  
#' @return climate4R grid. Calibrated forecasts.
