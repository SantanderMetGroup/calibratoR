#' @title Calibration of seasonal climate forecasts.
#' @description This function implements the method 1 described in Torralba et al. 2017, which has been previously applied 
#' in the context of seasonal forecasting to correct temperature and precipitation in Leung et al. 1999.
#' The ensemble mean produced by this method has the same mean and standard deviation as the observations. 
#' It is based on the assumption that both the reference and predicted distributions are approximated well by a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
#' @param fcst.grid climate4R grid. Forecasts to be calibrated (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis). At the moment, only gridded data are supported.
#' @param obs.grid climate4R grid. Reference observations the forecasts are calibrated towards (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis).
#' @param crossval Logical. TRUE (default) for leave-one-out cross-validation. FALSE for not cross-validation.
#' @return climate4R grid. Calibrated forecasts.
